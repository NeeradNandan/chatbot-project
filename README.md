This is a simple Chatbot project built with React and Vite. It uses [Chatbot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supersimpledev) package from @supersimpledev to generate responses to user input. It does three things :
- Replies to hello and thank you messages
- Tells you today's date
- Rolls a die
- Flips a coin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The chatbot may lead to inaccurate results since the responses are not AI-generated but rather are default, and it 
> reads user messages based on regex
